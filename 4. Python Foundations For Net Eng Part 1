Why learn Python:
    because it's awesome!!! :)
    python exists on most Linux systems, including NX-OS
    python has many many modules/ applications that's built for network engineering
    easy to use, quick to learn, yet very powerful and offers so much to network engineers who's leveraging network programmability and automation

Note: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed as you type it in the python console, no need to compile

Python 2.x:
    No longer under active development but supported by python community
    Better library support
    Default version running on Linux and MAC
    Supported on NX-OS

Python 3.x:
    Under active development
    Designed to be easier to learn (even easier)
    Fixed major issues in 2.x
    Not backward compatible

Note: since python 2.x still has a larger library, it is the version used

Executing python code
    Using python dynamic interpreter aka python console
    Writing python scripts

Using python interpreter (shell)
    Enter shell by typing python at Linux terminal or on a NX cli
    Exit shell by pressing ctrl + D

Writing python scripts
    it can be written in any text editor and saved in a .py file extension. you can then run this script by executing python filename.py
