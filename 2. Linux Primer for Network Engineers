Navigating the Linux file system:
    Root file system refer to by / aka root directory 
    Sudo = super do, executes a command with root privileges 

Sudo:
    Debian/Ubuntu doesn’t allow logging in as root
    Redhat/fedora allow a user to log in as root by default 
    You can configure who can run sudo in the sudoers file
    If you are at user@machinesname:/$ running ‘sudo su’ puts you in root shell root@machinename:/#
    
# remember in Linux terminal $ is an indication that current user has no root privileges, while # indicates you’re root
