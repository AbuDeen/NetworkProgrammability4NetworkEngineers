Navigating the Linux file system:
    Root file system refer to by / aka root directory 
    Sudo = super do, executes a command with root privileges 

Sudo:
    Debian/Ubuntu doesn’t allow logging in as root
    Redhat/fedora allow a user to log in as root by default 
    You can configure who can run sudo in the sudoers file
    If you are at user@machinesname:~$ running ‘sudo su’ puts you in root shell root@machinename:/# (Ctrl + D to return)
    
# remember in Linux terminal $ is an indication that current user has no root privileges, while # indicates you’re root

Path and Directories: 
    pwd = prints current working directory
    ls = lists content of current directory
    man <command> = shows manual of a command
    A path is a file or directory's location on a filesystem. There are two types of paths in Linux: 
        Relative path: relative to the current working directory
        Absolute path: relative to the root directory, starts with / e.g: /home/username/Desktop
Note: Linux terminal is case sensitive. So home is not the same as Home 
    Cd command:
        'cd ..' changes to parent directory of current directory 
        'cd' or 'cd ~' back to home directory (home = /home/username) 
        'cd .. / ..' back two directories. You can add dots and /s as you wish
        'cd -' changes to parent directory of current directory and prints parent directory
        
Linux distributions and package managers:
    Linux operating systems are distributed as complete collections of software built-around the Linux kernel and some form of package management system. These collections are called distributions (distros), and though there are almost 300 various distributions available today, most are derived from one of two main operating systems: Red Hat and Debian
    Distributions are commonly developed to meet specific end-user requirements. For example, Kali Linux is focused on penetration and security testing while OpenWrt is generally focused on home router functionality. CentOS is built for stability, whereas Fedora is considered less stable because it is a testing ground for new features
    The two main Linux OS are:
        Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL = Commercial OS. Derivatives are Fedora and CentOS
        Debian = Free and open source, developed under the Debian project. Most popular derivatives are Ubuntu, which has derivatives as well such as Linux Mint and Gnome

Package management:
    Packages are convenient methods to deliver software
    Package tool maintains a database of installed applications and their file locations
    Two main CLI tools required to install, update and remove software
    Installing software package:
        RHEL:
            rpm = installs a local rpm package (package has a .rpm file extension)
            yum = downloads and installs a package from repositories. Also updates and removes
        Debian:
            dpkg = installs a local rpm package (package has a .dpkg file extension)
            apt & apt-get = downloads and installs a package from repositories. Also updates and removes
