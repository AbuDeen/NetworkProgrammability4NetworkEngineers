Networking commands:
    ping
    traceroute = must be installed via sudo apt-get install traceroute
    ifconfig = display information for only one interface at a time. Also, ifconfig can be used to assign an IP address, shut and activate an interface, hardcode a MAC address, or even set the MTU of the interface
        e.g:
            ifconfig
            ifconfig interfacename up|down = shuts / unshuts an interface
    iplink = similar to ifconfig, more powerful. ifconfig will be decommed soon, repalced by ip link. shows each interface w/o inet address assigned to it
    ip addr list = shows list of interfaces with inet ip addresses assigned to it
    ip addr = assigns an ip to an interface. this assigment is not persistent, meaning it will be gone after a reboot
        e.g: sudo ip addr { add | del } a.b.c.d/yz dev <interface>
    ip route = creates a non-persistent static route
        e.g: sudo ip route { add | del } 172.16.10.0/24 via 192.168.200.50 dev eth1    (eth1 is egress interface)
    ifup/ifdown = up/down an interface
        e.g: sudo ifup lo
    netstat:
        netstat = displays local computer’s connection information, routing table information
        netstat -r = displays routing table
        netstat -i = displays interface statistics
            e.g: netstat -i lo
    dig = displays DNS info such as A, MX and CNAMES records. e.g: dig gmail.com
    host = resolves host to ip and lists MX, CNAMES associated with name queried. e.g: host gmail.com
    ssh = i think we all know what it does :)
        e.g:
            ssh 192.168.1.1 (uses username associated with current terminal)
            ssh admin@192.168.1.1 -p 2222
            ssh –l john 192.168.1.1

Viewing routing and ARP tables:
    ip route list = shows local route table. cleaner output than netstat -r and becoming the Linux standard. can be used to add/del routes
    route = same as ip route list
    arp = shows local arp table and assign static arp

Persistent network configuration:
    changing ip information:
        persistent network configs are added to the interfaces file under /etc/network. nano /etc/network/interfaces
             e.g:
                 auto eth0
                 iface eth0 inet static
                 address 192.168.1.50
                 netmask 255.255.255.0
                 up ip route add 172.16.10.0/24 via 192.168.1.25 dev eth2
                 up ip route add 10.10.10.0/24 via 192.168.1.35 dev eth3

                 auto eth1
                 iface eth1 inet dhcp

    changing DNS information:
        persistent DNS configs are stored in the resolv.conf file under /etc/. nano /etc/resolv.conf
        dynamically constructed from files located in: /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/
        to manually add a DNS entry:
            add 'nameserver 127.0.1.1' to etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d
            run sudo resolvconf -u to instruct Linux to update resolv.conf from resolv.conf.d

    restarting network service:
        must be done after changing an ip, mask, GW or adding additional interfaces
        run sudo service networking restart
